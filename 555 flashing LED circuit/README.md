555 flashing LED circuit
========================

A simple 555 time monostable circuit. Using the capacity and resistor values
here, the LED will blink at 1.39 kHz with a duty cycle of 54.8%, or to look at
it another way, it will be on for 396µs and off for 326µs. Of course, this is
too fast for the human eye to see, so you can hook up an oscilloscope to TP1
which should be able to see the square waveform.
